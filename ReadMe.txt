Instructions to run the Suit files:

1) Download main.c, suit.h, suit.c

2) Make sure the three files are in the same folder

3) Find the files on your computer by providing valid location

    ex. paola@laptopvm:~/Desktop/ProgrammingIII/ProgrammingIII$...

4) To compile the files using either gcc or cc you must enter in
    the following format:

    gcc main.c suit.h suit.c

            OR

    cc main.c suit.h suit.c

    NOTE: The format should look something like this:

    paola@laptopvm:~/Desktop/ProgrammingIII/ProgrammingIII$ gcc main.c suit.h suit.c

5) To execute the input you must enter the values after ./a.out
    consecutively

    ex. ./a.out 4 5

    where ./a.out executes the files, 4 determines the number of
    cards per hand/player and 5 determines the number of players.
    If your values are invalid you will receive an error message
    and the program will terminate as directed by instructions.

***Make sure to have your terminal window is a reasonable size enough
   to display 13 columns (cards) horizontally since some OSs may not
   format the output to fit your screen accordingly.
