/*
  main.c
  suit

 This program simulates a card game with a deck of 52 cards and 4 suits.
 User input is accepted via the terminal with two arguments. Argument 1 
 determines the number of cards to deal per hand/player and the Argument 2
 determines the number of players. Reasonable computation is performed so
 the values do not violate the deck size. For example max number of cards 
 per 4 players is 13 since the product of the two is 52 (the size of the deck).
 But the product of 14 cards per hand/player and 4 players is not permitted. 
 In that case the program will terminate with an error message. Other attributes
 include shuffling and dealing the deck and displaying both deck and hands.
